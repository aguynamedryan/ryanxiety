# Why I sought counseling

For a very, very long time, I felt like I had a monster living inside me.  And yes, I'm borrowing from Dexter's idea of a monster inside.  His was to kill people, mine was an explosive temper that I struggled to keep under control.

I'd always had a "short temper" but as I got older, and my responsibilities increased, my temper became shorter and shorter.  I remember a distinct event in my life that illustrates just how short (and honestly, unpredictable) that temper had become.

Jen and I were in escrow for our house and several people sent us congratulations.  One evening, as Jen mentioned these congratulations out-loud, I began to yell.  I screamed "why is everyone congratulating us?!  We're in escrow!  We don't know we have the house yet!"  I believe I'd also accidentally signed a document that caused our escrow to be shortened by a week or something, so I felt both guilty and nervous.  But mostly, I felt scared.  And when I feel scared, I express that fear in anger.

I yell.  Hell, I even throw tantrums akin to those of my toddler son.  It's embarrassing.  When I do it I immediately feel guilty, stupid, and ridiculous.  And by immediately, I mean as I'm doing it.  But I used to do it all the time.  I couldn't help myself.  The guilt/upset I felt simply overcame me and I expressed it in a fit of rage.

I want to make one thing clear right off the bat.  I was never *physically* abusive.  That wasn't in my repertoire.  But I sure could raise my voice and make everyone in the world around me feel very uncomfortable.  Which, to me, seems like emotional abuse, and, to me, is as egregious as physical abuse.  I felt I was abusive.

In hindsight, there is a strong correlation between an increase in my personal responsibilities and my inclination to fly off into a rage.  As the pressure grew on me to be "adult" I became more and more stressed and prone to upset.

Obviously, the birth of a child introduces a large increase in responsibility.  For me, that translated into a large increase in tantrums.  My sense of responsibility as a father drove me deeper and deeper into my tantrums.  I was worried about so many more variables.  I was responsible for another human being's existence.  I was expected to be the role-model for a young boy.

I broke.  I knew I broke.  I was charged with Max's care-taking for 6 weeks and on week 2, I found myself yelling at a small infant in a swinging chair.  I knew I was out of control and I marched upstairs and called the first counselor I could find on yelp that dealt with Anger Management.  Clearly, I was an Angry Guy.

In my first encounter with the counselor, I spent about 45 minutes recounting my angers, my fears, and my concerns.  He told me I should work on "counting to ten" and that he had a group therapy session with (mostly court-appointed) people to discuss anger that I might benefit from.  He also mocked me at one point for the kinds of fears I revealed to him.  I'm many things, but I'm not dumb enough to have tried counting to 10.  And I'm also not thrilled to have my fears mocked by a "professional".  I opted to never see him again.  But, unfortunately, I opted to not seek out other therapists.
