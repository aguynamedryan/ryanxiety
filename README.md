I'm Ryan and I see a therapist and take medication to keep calm and be an awesome human being.  Feel free to ask me anything.

As some, but not enough, of you know, I've been in counseling since February, 2015.  I've been taking Sertraline (Zoloft) since July, 2015.

I'm engaging in these two therapies in order to combat a diagnosis of Aggravated Depression (depression with anxiety sprinkled (in my case heavily) on top).

I'm mentioning this because I'm happy to talk about my experience with anxiety, depression, counseling, and sertraline.  Every time Jen and I have hung out with friends, I end up revealing this journey to one or two friends.  And, almost every time, I notice or discover a friend is wrestling with similar issues.  It is silly when good friends aren't talking to each other about their inner-demons and how they are engaging with them.

So, if anyone feels like they are irrationally angry, inexplicably anxious, or feeling sad and disconnected for no reason, I'm hear to talk to.  I can't guarantee that I have the solution to your problems, but I want you to know that there might be something out there that can help you and that you might not have to live this way forever.  At least I can assure you that you're not alone.

I've setup a blog with much more detail at: ???? if you're interested.  It's a work in progress and I will be actively revising and adding posts as I have time.
