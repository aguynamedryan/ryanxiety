# Rock Bottom

For the next year and a half, I did my best to be the best father I knew how.  I wrestled with my internal demon (anger) as much as I could, but my tantrums (which is trivializing how much I yelled and slammed doors) continued to increase each day.  Simply put, I was an unstable, very upset parent, virtually every day.

One night Jen and I watched the movie "Boyhood" which tracked a boy's development from the age of 5 through 18-ish.  As Jen soaked in a tub, 5-months pregnant with Sam, we discussed the movie.  I confessed to Jen that I sadly felt similar to the father-figures the main character had encountered in his development (i.e. impotently raging sticklers for rules and respect).  Jen declared that she had finally figured me out and that I was no different from another, very horrible, figure in her life.

I felt anguish.  I felt pure terror.  I felt Jen had finally seen the real me.  I could not deny any of her claims.  I wanted to, but I could not.  After 11 years, I felt she had finally come to understand the real me.  And she despised him.  For the next week, I stayed in the guest bedroom because Jen simply couldn't stand to be around me.
